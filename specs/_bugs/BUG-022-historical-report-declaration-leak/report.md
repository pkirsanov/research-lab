# Report: BUG-022 Historical Report Declaration Leak

Links: [scopes.md](scopes.md) | [uservalidation.md](uservalidation.md)

## Current Packet Report

### Summary

The filing phase identified an artifact-authority defect in
`collectDeclaredTestGlobs()`. The parser treats immutable `report.md` receipts
as current Node suite declarations. A report-only Feature 008 pattern causes
eight false runner crossings. Excluding report receipts also exposes two real
Node families whose current authority must be made explicit.

### Completion Statement

The bug packet is filed and the parser root cause is diagnosed. No source or
test fix is claimed. No test-pass, validation-pass, or certification claim is
made. Status remains `in_progress`.

### Test Evidence

No implementation or test phase has executed for this packet. The operator's
failing command is diagnostic input only until the test owner re-executes it.

## Bug Reproduction - Before Fix

**Phase:** bug
**Command:** `node --test tests/playwright-runtime.foundation.functional.mjs`
**Exit Code:** not executed by this agent
**Claim Source:** not-run

> **Uncertainty Declaration**
> **What was attempted:** The filing phase executed the production parser and a declaration-authority counterfactual, not the Node test runner.
> **What was observed:** The operator supplied an 8-path failure. Current parser execution identified the same report-only pattern and its eight selected paths.
> **Why this is uncertain:** Operator-provided output cannot be restated as this agent's execution evidence.
> **What would resolve this:** The test owner must run the exact command before any implementation edit and record its real exit and output here.

## Diagnostic Evidence - Declaration Authority Counterfactual

**Phase:** bug
**Command:** current-session Node diagnostic importing `collectDeclaredTestGlobs`, `globToRegExp`, and `validateTestFileReachability`, then filtering only sites whose basename is `report.md`
**Exit Code:** 0
**Claim Source:** interpreted
**Interpretation:** The portfolio pattern is historical rather than active because all eight new crossings disappear when only report receipt sites are removed. The same filter reveals active-declaration debt for two separate Node families, so report scoping must ship with explicit command-registry declarations.

```text
reportOnlyPatterns:
  tests/*.functional.mjs
  tests/*.test.mjs
  tests/portfolio-*.mjs
crossingsBefore:
  9 frozen crossings
  8 portfolio-survival crossings
crossingsAfterExcludingReportReceipts:
  9 frozen crossings
  0 portfolio-survival crossings
currentOrphanCount: 7
activeAuthorityOrphanCount: 40
newlyExposedOrphans: 33
COUNTERFACTUAL_EXIT=0
```

The complete output was retained by the current-session terminal tool result.
This compact block records the discriminating signals without claiming that the
runtime-foundation test itself ran.

## Root Cause Evidence

**Claim Source:** interpreted
**Interpretation:** Source inspection identifies the mechanism that produced the executed diagnostic.

- `listFilesRecursive()` traverses every non-ignored directory.
- `collectDeclaredTestGlobs()` excludes only its own source and baseline.
- Every other readable text line is tested with `NODE_TEST_INVOCATION`.
- No function classifies `report.md` as execution evidence rather than command authority.
- The Feature 008 BUG-004 report line 3856 is the only site for `tests/portfolio-*.mjs`.

## Origin And Packet Ownership

**Phase:** bug
**Command:** fresh `git fetch origin main`, local `find specs -type d -name 'BUG-*'`, and `git ls-tree -d --name-only origin/main:specs/_bugs`
**Exit Code:** 0
**Claim Source:** executed

```text
local HEAD: 9dbd3b87c
origin/main: 3c8828f7c
local highest cross-feature id: BUG-021
origin/main highest cross-feature id: BUG-021
worktree count: 1
existing owner for this defect: none found
assigned packet: BUG-022-historical-report-declaration-leak
FETCH_EXIT=0
ORIGIN_TREE_EXIT=0
```

## Invocation Audit

No subagent was invoked during packet filing. The host runtime exposes no
`runSubagent` tool in this invocation, so design, planning, implementation,
test, validation, documentation, and recap dispatches remain unclaimed.

## Planning Handoff

Scope 1 maps repository closure to
`scripts/validate-test-file-reachability.mjs` and focused authority behavior to
`tests/playwright-runtime.foundation.functional.mjs`. These are planned test
paths only. This section records no implementation, execution, or pass claim.

## Change Ledger

The filing operation created only the eight artifacts in this BUG-022 packet.
No source, test, command-registry, historical report, protected bug packet, or
concurrent dirty path was edited by the filing phase.
